#  Ally Care  :  " Smart Assitant Bot for simplifying your issue  " 
 
![Ally Care](https://github.com/uchiha-vivek/IBM-watsonx-Assistant)

 

 Under the larger scope, I aim to address the issues associated with long and tedious telephonic calls, which often lead to frustrated clients. To tackle this problem, IBM Watsonx Assistant provides a powerful and efficient solution for creating conversational bots that can be retrained using their own data. These bots can be utilized to address challenges across various industries, such as Banking and Financial Services, Bill Payments, Telecommunications, Healthcare, Education, and Retail and E-commerce. Each industry has its unique set of problems, further divided into multiple subsets. I aim to address such industry-specific issues using Watsonx Assistant. For my use case, I have focused on the Healthcare industry, where a person may need to pay their medical bill and book an appointment with a specific doctor for cardiology issues. These bots save significant time otherwise spent on phone calls, which often disrupt systems and delay responses. With these bots, patients can conveniently use the assistant from anywhere, simplifying their tasks. This ensures ease for patients and allows the entire system to run smoothly. For my project, I have tried to showcase this idea. Although I haven‚Äôt incorporated complex conditions, the solution is well-structured. This concept can be adapted for various industries, and my goal is to develop such specific assistants that address core challenges across domains effectively.

 NOTE : Many Features has to be developed yet .
